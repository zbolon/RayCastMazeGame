# RayCastMazeGame
- This is a raycasted maze game using a style similar to Doom
- The code works by converting a 2d grid into 3d
- It accomplishes this by sending rays out from the player until it hits a wall. Once it hits the wall it calculates the length of that ray and draws it proportionally to the screen
- The objective is to find the grey wall (end) as fast as you can
